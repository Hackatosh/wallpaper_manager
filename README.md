# Wallpaper Changer Project

Welcome to the repository of Wallpaper Changer !

This project is a personal project started in February 2020. 
The goal of the project is to provide a little service to change your wallpaper automatically at predefined hours,
allowing you to have different wallpaper for the morning and the evening as an example, a functionality which does
not exist natively in Windows.

## Getting Started
